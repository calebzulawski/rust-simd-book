# Masks

Rust also provides a "truthy" vector type: [`Mask<T, N>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/simd/struct.Mask.html).

While operating like `bool`, the element type of a mask is always a signed integer.
The size of the integer corresponds to the vector elements that the mask can interact with.

Masks operate like `[bool; N]`, but their layout is unspecified and target-specific.

## Elementwise operations with masks

Masks are typically prodced by comparisons.
Like vectors, they also support elementwise operations:

```rust
# #![feature(portable_simd)]
# fn main() {}
// m32x4 is an alias for Mask<i32, 4>
//
// SimdPartialOrd is the elementwise counterpart to PartialOrd,
// and provides `simd_lt`, `simd_gt`, etc.
use std::simd::{f32x4, m32x4, SimdPartialOrd};

fn is_between(x: f32x4, lower_bound: f32x4, upper_bound: f32x4) -> m32x4 {
    let above_lower_bound: m32x4 = x.simd_gt(lower_bound);
    let below_upper_bound: m32x4 = x.simd_lt(upper_bound);
    above_lower_bound & below_upper_bound
}
```

## Reduction operations

Masks also support reduction operations:

```rust
# #![feature(portable_simd)]
# fn main() {}
use std::simd::{f32x4, m32x4, SimdFloat}; // SimdFloat provides is_infinite

fn any_infinite(vectors: &[f32x4]) -> bool {
    let mut infinite = m32x4::splat(false);
    for v in vectors {
        infinite |= v.is_infinite();
    }
    
    // check if any element is `true`
    infinite.any()
}
```

## Conditionally selecting elements

Masks can be used to conditionally select elements from two vectors:

```rust
# #![feature(portable_simd)]
# fn main() {}
use std::simd::{f32x4, m32x4, SimdFloat}; // SimdFloat provides is_nan

/// replace nan values with 0
fn replace_nan(x: f32x4) -> f32x4 {
    let nans: m32x4 = x.is_nan();
    nans.select(f32x4::splat(0.0), x)
}
```
