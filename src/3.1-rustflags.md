# Program-wide with RUSTFLAGS

Target features can be enabled program-wide by setting `RUSTFLAGS`.
The following example enables `avx` and `avx2`, and disables `fma`:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-Ctarget-features=+avx,+avx2,-fma" cargo build
```

Instead of targeting specific features, a particular CPU can be targeted:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-Ctarget-cpu=skylake" cargo build
```

Rust can also target your specific CPU, with the special `native` CPU:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-Ctarget-cpu=native" cargo build
```


```admonish warning
Enabling features program-wide can be dangerous!

If the program runs on a CPU that does not have an enabled feature, the program will crash.
```
