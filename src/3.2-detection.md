# Runtime detection of target features

To safely use an optional target feature, the program must detect it at runtime.
Once a feature is detected, it can be safely used:

```rust
#[target_feature(enable = "avx")]
unsafe fn use_avx() {
    println!("This function uses AVX!")
}

fn main() {
    if is_x86_feature_detected!("avx") {
        unsafe { use_avx() }
    } else {
        println!("We can't use AVX.");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `target_feature` attribute enables the `avx` feature.
Unlike setting the target features with `RUSTFLAGS`, this limits the features to particular functions.
The `is_*_feature_detected` macros can then be used to check if the feature is supported, and safely handle the situation where the feature is not present.
