# Vectors

Rust provides portable SIMD vectors with the [`Simd` type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/simd/struct.Simd.html).

`Simd<T, N>` can be thought of as a variation of `[T; N]`.
`Simd` has the same "shape" as an array, but with a greater alignment.
In fact, `Simd<T, N>` is easily convertible to and from `[T; N]`, and supports some of the same operations, such as indexing.

## Elementwise operations on vectors

Unlike arrays, `Simd<T, N>` is not just a container.
While it looks like an array, it also operates like `T`.
Vectors implement all of the same basic operators as its scalar type `T`, meaning you can do the following:

```rust
# #![feature(portable_simd)]
# fn main() {}
use std::simd::f32x4; // an alias for Simd<f32, 4>

/// y = mx + b
fn y(m: f32x4, x: f32x4, b: f32x4) -> f32x4 {
    m * x + b
}
```

These operators work _elementwise_, meaning the operator is applied to each element separately.

Vectors even implement special functions (e.g. `abs`) with traits:

```rust
# #![feature(portable_simd)]
# fn main() {}
use std::simd::{f32x4, SimdFloat}; // SimdFloat provides abs

/// |a - b|
fn distance(a: f32x4, b: f32x4) -> f32x4 {
    (a - b).abs()
}
```

## Reduction operations

Sometimes you may want to perform an operation across a single vector, rather than between vectors.
These operations are referred to as _reductions_:

```rust
# #![feature(portable_simd)]
# fn main() {}
use std::simd::{f32x4, SimdFloat}; // SimdFloat provides reduce_sum

fn sum(vectors: &[f32x4]) -> f32 {
    let mut sums = f32x4::splat(0.0); // splat fills each element with the value
    for v in vectors {
        sums += v;
    }
    
    // `sums` now contains the elementwise sums, so we must sum across the vector
    sums.reduce_sum()
}
```


```admonish note
Reductions are slower than elementwise operations in most cases.
It's best to use elementwise operations when possible, and use reductions only when necessary.
```
