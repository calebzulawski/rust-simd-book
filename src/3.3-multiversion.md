# The easy way, with multiversion

The [`multiversion` crate](https://crates.io/crates/multiversion) is helpful for automatically *multiversioning* functions.

A multiversioned function is one that's compiled multiple times for any number of targets, with the optimal function selected at runtime.

```rust,ignore
use multiversion::multiversion;

#[multiversion(targets(
    "x86_64+avx",
    "x86_64+sse4.2",
    "arm+neon",
))]
fn multiversioned() {
    println!("This function uses whichever features are available")
}
```

Multiversion also supports automatically targeting all SIMD features on all architectures:
```rust,ignore
use multiversion::multiversion;

#[multiversion(targets = "simd")]
fn multiversioned() {
    println!("This function automatically uses the best SIMD feature available")
}
```

For each target, a copy of the function is compiled with the appropriate `target_feature` attributes.
At runtime, the optimal function is selected.

Compared to the example on the previous page, `multiversion` also selects the appropriate function with less performance overhead.
