# Portable SIMD Programming in Rust
by Caleb Zulawski

Rust's portable SIMD module enables users to write high performace code without wading into the arcane details of instruction sets.

This book is intended for anyone who is familiar with Rust and curious about SIMD.
A few types of people who might benefit from reading this:
* Someone who has never used SIMD but is interested in speeding up their code's arithmetic
* A programmer looking to simplify a codebase with target-specific SIMD code
* An experienced SIMD programmer who wants to branch out to other target architectures
* Someone already familiar with portable SIMD who wants to fill out their knowledge
